Project: Corona Lung Data Set-CNN

About the DataSet

DataSet contains Normal and Covid effected lungs images.

We need to identify whether the person is covid effected or not by seeing thier lungs images

What we have done!

1.Take data via OpenCv

2.Model Building using Tensorflow and Keras

3.Save the weight file

4.Plot loss and Accuracy graphs

5.Load weight test on new data

Tools we have use:

1.Numpy

2.Os

3.Cv2

4.Keras

5.Tensorflow
