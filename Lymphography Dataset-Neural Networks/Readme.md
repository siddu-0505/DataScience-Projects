What we have done!
1.Perform EDA

2.Apply imblearn SMOTH algorithm to balance the classes

3.Creating the algorithm use tensorflow-keras to create the neural network

4.Tune the Model using GridSearchCV

5.Plot accuracy a loss graphs

6.Test the model

Tools we have used:

1.Numpy

2.Pandas

3.Matplotlib

4.Seaborn

5.Sklearn

6.Tensorflow
